Project: Options Trading Analytics Dashboard

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
This is a full-stack web application designed to help traders (specifically Nick, a finance professional) track and analyze stock options pricing over 1-2 week periods. The goal is to identify premium/discount opportunities by monitoring implied volatility, Greeks, and pricing inefficiencies in real-time.

ARCHITECTURE & TECH STACK
=========================

Backend (Python)
- Framework: FastAPI for REST API endpoints
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for local data storage
- Data Sources: Yahoo Finance API via `yfinance` library
- Options Calculations: `py_vollib` for Black-Scholes model and Greeks
- Scheduling: APScheduler for periodic data fetching
- Key Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy for financial calculations

Frontend (React)
- Framework: React with modern hooks
- Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Charts: Chart.js or Plotly for financial visualizations
- State Management: React Context/useState for data flow

Deployment Requirements
- Platform: Apple Silicon macOS 15.2 compatible
- Local Development: Designed to run locally with minimal setup

DATABASE SCHEMA
===============
The application uses 7 main tables:

1. symbols - Watchlist of stocks (AAPL, MSFT, SPY, etc.)
2. stock_prices - Historical stock price data
3. option_contracts - Options contract specifications
4. option_prices - Time series of option pricing data
5. iv_analysis - Implied volatility analysis and rankings
6. trading_opportunities - Automated opportunity detection
7. user_watchlists - Personalized symbol tracking

CORE FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS
============================

Implied Volatility Analysis
- IV Rank: Current IV vs 1-year high/low range (0-100%)
- IV Percentile: Current IV vs historical distribution
- IV Skew: Put vs call IV differences

Greeks Tracking
- Delta: Price sensitivity to underlying movement
- Theta: Time decay per day
- Gamma: Delta sensitivity to price changes
- Vega: Volatility sensitivity
- Rho: Interest rate sensitivity

Opportunity Identification
- Options trading >20% above/below theoretical value
- IV Rank >80% (expensive) or <20% (cheap)
- Unusual volume (>150% of average)
- High time value near expiration

API ENDPOINTS STRUCTURE
=======================

Stock Data
- GET /api/stocks - List watchlist symbols
- GET /api/stocks/{symbol}/price - Current stock price
- GET /api/stocks/{symbol}/history - Price history

Options Data
- GET /api/options/{symbol}/chain - Full options chain
- GET /api/options/{symbol}/analysis - IV analysis
- GET /api/options/opportunities - Current trading opportunities

Watchlist Management
- POST /api/watchlist - Add symbol to watchlist
- DELETE /api/watchlist/{symbol} - Remove symbol
- GET /api/watchlist - Get current watchlist

KEY FEATURES FOR NICK
=====================

Daily Workflow Support
1. Morning Dashboard: Overnight changes, new opportunities
2. Deep Analysis: Drill-down into specific options chains
3. Opportunity Scanner: Real-time alerts for mispriced options
4. Historical Tracking: Performance of identified opportunities

Trading-Focused Metrics
- Options with IV Rank >80% (potential sells)
- Options with IV Rank <20% (potential buys)
- Time decay acceleration near expiration
- Volume/Open Interest anomalies

DATA UPDATE STRATEGY
====================
- Market Hours: Every 15 minutes via scheduled tasks
- After Hours: End-of-day comprehensive update
- Weekends: Historical analysis and opportunity review
- Rate Limiting: Respect Yahoo Finance API limits

DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
======================

Phase 1 (Current MVP)
- [x] Database models and basic data fetching
- [x] Yahoo Finance integration
- [ ] FastAPI REST endpoints
- [ ] Basic React frontend
- [ ] Options calculations with py_vollib

Phase 2 (Enhancement)
- [ ] Historical IV analysis
- [ ] Opportunity scoring algorithm
- [ ] Real-time alerts
- [ ] Interactive charts

Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Portfolio position tracking
- [ ] Strategy backtesting
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Multiple data source integration

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Backend Setup
cd backend
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python models.py  # Initialize database
python data_fetcher.py  # Test data fetching
python app.py  # Start FastAPI server

Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm start  # Start development server

KEY DEVELOPMENT NOTES
=====================

For Financial Accuracy
- All monetary values stored as floats with 4 decimal precision
- Greeks calculated using Black-Scholes model
- IV calculations use Newton-Raphson method
- Risk-free rate fetched from FRED API

For Performance
- Database indexes on symbol + timestamp
- Calculated metrics cached to avoid recalculation
- Background processing for heavy computations
- Rate limiting to avoid API blocks

For User Experience
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go checking
- Real-time updates during market hours
- Clean, professional interface suitable for finance professionals
- Progressive disclosure (overview → details)

CURRENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS
============================
The backend foundation is complete with data models and fetching capabilities. The immediate next steps are:
1. Complete the FastAPI endpoints in app.py
2. Implement options calculations in calculations.py
3. Build the React frontend with basic dashboard
4. Add opportunity detection algorithms
5. Implement real-time data updates

This architecture provides Nick with a professional-grade tool for systematic options analysis while remaining simple enough for personal use and enhancement.
